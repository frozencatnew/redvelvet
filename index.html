<pre>so this is like my personal website/blog cause i felt like it
i am from the epic land of australia the only thing notable about where i live is someone here caused a fish invasion here<br>  
i like to just play around with tech stuff like modding consoles and i collect games for them too also i like pokemon (psyduck is the best)<br>  
i used to be obese but i lost weight<br>
hopefully you like the website cause i spent money on this<br>
tbh imreally bad at this stuff i hope that i can learn and maybe people who are also smooth brained can learn about this stuff<br>
